zfs-fuse for Debian
-------------------

ZFS uses a very different configuration system than traditional filesystems
in Debian. The full details may be found in zfs(8) and zpool(8); you can get
started quickly with:
  
  # zpool create zfs hdx4

This will create a ZFS filesystem mounted at /zfs on /dev/hdx4. For more
details please see the relevant manpages and/or the website[1].

zfs-fuse currently should not be used with system volumes such as /var or
/usr. /home will probably work (but see below about stability).

zfs-fuse requires a FUSE module for your kernel. Pre-built modules are included
in recent debian kernels.

Please note that zfs-fuse is not proven stable enough for production use,
although we have gone long times without reported data loss. It is not yet
recommended for production data or on production systems.
