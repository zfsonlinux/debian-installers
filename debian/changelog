base-installer (0.006) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support comments in /cdrom/.disk/* files.  Thanks to Petter
    Reinholdtsen for pointing this out.
  * The support for /cdrom/.disk/* files was quite broken -- a delimiter
    was added to the end.  This caused lots of grief, which should now be
    fixed.
  * Fix path to base_{include,exclude} files.
