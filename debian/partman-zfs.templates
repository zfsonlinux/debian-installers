_Description: Go back to the menu and correct this problem?
 You have configured one or more partitions with the ZFS file
 system. Although ZFS is supported on 32-bit i386, using it without
 special tuning may lead to performance or stability problems
 due to limitations of this architecture.
 .
 You should either use the 64-bit (amd64) version of this
 installer (if your hardware supports this), or go back to the
 partitioning menu and configure the partitions to use another
 file system.

_Description: Go back to the menu and correct this problem?
 You have configured one or more partitions with the ZFS file
 system. Using ZFS on a computer with less than 512 MB of memory
 may lead to stability problems and is not recommended.
 .
 You should go back to the partitioning menu and configure
 the partitions to use another file system.

_Description: Write the changes to disk and configure ZFS?
 Before ZFS can be configured, the current
 partitioning scheme has to be written to disk. These changes cannot
 be undone.

 After ZFS is configured, no additional changes
 to the partitioning scheme of disks containing physical volumes are
 allowed during the installation. Please decide if you are satisfied
 with the current partitioning scheme before continuing.

Template: partman-zfs/help
Type: note
# :sl4:
_Description: ZFS
 A common situation for system administrators is to find that some disk
 partition (usually the most important one) is short on space, while some
 other partition is underused. ZFS can help with this.
 .
 ZFS allows combining disk or partition devices ("physical volumes") to form
 a virtual disk ("ZFS pool"), which can then be divided into virtual
 partitions ("logical volumes"). ZFS pools and logical volumes may span
 across several physical disks. New physical volumes may be added to a ZFS pool
 at any time, and logical volumes have no size limit other than the total
 size of the ZFS pool.
 .
 The items on the ZFS configuration menu can be used to edit ZFS pools
 and logical volumes. After you return to the main partition manager screen,
 logical volumes will be displayed in the same way as ordinary partitions,
 and should be treated as such.
