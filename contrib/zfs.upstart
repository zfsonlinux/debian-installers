# /etc/init/zfs-fuse.conf: zfs-fuse daemon
# ----------------------------------------
# This simple SysV init-script replacement works very nicely on my boxen Note:
# zfs-fuse 0.6.9 (maint) or later is assumed here with respect to various
# init/shutdown improvements made there. In fact you may want to consider the
# testing branch
#
# TIP:
# ----
# I usually mount one specific mountpoint in post-start and defer the other
# mounts/imports (if any) to other upstart jobs for quick startup. YMMV
#
# TIP:
# ----
# If you have e.g. /home on zfs-fuse, you might want to add ' and started
# zfs-fuse' to the start condition of gdm

##	to enable core files:
#	ulimit -c 512000
	exec /usr/local/sbin/zfs-fuse --no-daemon
end script

post-start script
	/usr/local/sbin/zfs mount -a
end script

pre-stop script
#	/usr/local/sbin/zfs umount -a
##	simply trusting zfs-fuse to umount seems to be faster and more reliable
end script
