# This setting can eat as much as 150 Mb of ram, so uncomment if you want
# to save some ram and are ready to loose a little speed.

# something specific about ARC.

# OBSOLETE: disable-page-cache
# uncomment this to disable fuse page cache.
# This cache allows fuse to cache high level read requests
# there is no reason to disable it usually, except for testing.

# Not generally recommended because it currently has a significant performance
# penalty for many small IOPS

# seconds)
# These 2 values have a big impact on performance for small io operations
# There are 3 possibilities :
# 1) if you use fuese-mount-options=default_permissions then you can set these
#    2 as high as you want (that's the case here). It's probably the best option
# 2) Otherwise if you still want to keep posix file permissions without loosing
#    too much speed, set these 2 to at least 1s.
# 3) Last case : you want perfect posix conformance, wihtout default_permissions
#    in this case set these to 0, but be ready to loose quite some speed !
# Default is to use default_permissions, so these as high as you want.

# fuse-mount-options : supplemental fuse mount options for the zfs volumes.
# fuse mount options which are always passed include :

# zfs-fuse uses lots of threads (about 150), and the default stack size for

# So you can limit it here, in kb. Default is no limit
